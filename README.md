# Fairprice Scraper

This script scrapes data from https://www.fairprice.com.sg/, a domain owned by Singapore's largest supermarket chain, NTUC Fairprice Co-Operative. This script scrapes all the products' details pertaining to a particular search query. As an additional feature, the returned result only shows the 10 cheapest relevant products within a specified price-range.

Built With
-----
* Python 3.7
* Selenium 3.141.0 and Chromedriver

Setting Up
-----
What we need:
* Python 3.7 
* Selenium 3.141.0
* Webdriver (i.e. Chrome, Firefox etc. extension)
* An IDE or Jupyter Notebook (should we prefer to avoid installation, Google Co-lab might be an option)

Although these are the key installations required, consider looking at the requirements.txt file which documents all the packages and versions contained in the environment I ran the webscraper in. 

Before downloading the webdriver, ensure that the desired installation is compatible with your operating system. Additionally, the driver should sit in the same directory you would be running your program from.

Running the Program
-----
You can download or clone this repository and open the program in your desired IDE/Notebook.
